☆ Change gamma, brightness, and contrast. (Old programs used to change brightness automatically when you set gamma too high — this program only changes the gamma when adjusting gamma settings.)

☆ Choose which monitor you want to adjust. (Old gamma tools only worked on a single display.)

☆ Calculate recommended settings using interpolation.
